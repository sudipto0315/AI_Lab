'''
You are required to implement the Minimax algorithm along with Alpha-Beta Pruning
for a two-player game of your choice. The game should have a well-defined state
space and should be suitable for demonstrating the effectiveness of both algorithms.
(a) Implement the game rules: Create the necessary data structures and functions to
represent the game state, allow players to make moves, and determine when the game
is over. Define an evaluation function to estimate the desirability of a game state for
the maximizing player.
(b) Implement the Minimax algorithm: Write the Minimax algorithm to search the
game tree and determine the best move for the maximizing player while assuming the
opponent plays optimally.

(c) Implement Alpha-Beta Pruning: Extend your implementation to incorporate Alpha-
Beta Pruning.
